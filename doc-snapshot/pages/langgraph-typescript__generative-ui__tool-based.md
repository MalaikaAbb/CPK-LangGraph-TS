# Components as Tools

> Let your agent render rich React components directly in the chat by calling them as tools.


<!-- interactive demo: gen-ui-tool-based -->


## What is this?

Tool-based Generative UI is the simplest form of Generative UI: you register
a React component with `useComponent`, and CopilotKit exposes it to the
agent as a tool. When the agent calls the tool, CopilotKit renders your
component inline in the chat, passing the tool's arguments straight through
as typed props.

Unlike [tool rendering](/langgraph-typescript/generative-ui/tool-rendering), which wraps a
real backend tool in a custom UI, tool-based GenUI is the component. There
is no handler, no user interaction, no server-side execution. The agent
decides when to show it, populates the data, and CopilotKit paints it.

## When should I use this?

Use `useComponent` when you want to:

- Display rich UI (cards, charts, tables, dashboards) inline in the chat
- Show structured data the agent has derived from its reasoning
- Render previews, status indicators, or visual summaries
- Let the agent present information beyond plain text

For components that need user interaction, see
[Human-in-the-loop](/langgraph-typescript/human-in-the-loop). For operational transparency
around a real backend tool, see [Tool rendering](/langgraph-typescript/generative-ui/tool-rendering).

## How it works in code

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the CopilotKit LangGraph SDK

    ```bash
    npm install @copilotkit/sdk-js
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Wire CopilotKit state + tools into your graph

    Frontend tools registered with `useFrontendTool` arrive on the agent's
    state at `state.copilotkit.actions`. Use `CopilotKitStateAnnotation` to
    expose that channel on your graph, then call
    `convertActionsToDynamicStructuredTools(...)` inside your chat node to
    bind the LLM to those actions.

    
~~~~typescript title="frontend-tools.ts"
import { RunnableConfig } from "@langchain/core/runnables";
import { SystemMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { MemorySaver, START, StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { makeChatOpenAI } from "./openai-headers";

import {
  convertActionsToDynamicStructuredTools,
  CopilotKitStateAnnotation,
} from "@copilotkit/sdk-js/langgraph";

// CopilotKit forwards frontend tools to the agent via
// `state.copilotkit.actions`. `CopilotKitStateAnnotation` adds that
// channel to your graph's state; `convertActionsToDynamicStructuredTools`
// turns the forwarded action schemas into LangChain tools you can bind
// at model-invocation time.
const AgentStateAnnotation = CopilotKitStateAnnotation;
export type AgentState = typeof AgentStateAnnotation.State;

const SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a helpful, concise assistant.";

async function chatNode(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) {
  const model = makeChatOpenAI(config, {
    temperature: 0,
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  });

  const modelWithTools = model.bindTools!([
    ...convertActionsToDynamicStructuredTools(state.copilotkit?.actions ?? []),
  ]);

  const response = await modelWithTools.invoke(
    [new SystemMessage({ content: SYSTEM_PROMPT }), ...state.messages],
    config,
  );

  return { messages: response };
}

const workflow = new StateGraph(AgentStateAnnotation)
  .addNode("chat_node", chatNode)
  .addEdge(START, "chat_node")
  .addEdge("chat_node", "__end__");

const memory = new MemorySaver();

export const graph = workflow.compile({
  checkpointer: memory,
});

`useComponent` takes a name, a Zod schema for its props, and the component
to render. The runtime registers it as a frontend tool so the agent can
discover it, and Zod validates the LLM's arguments before they reach your
component.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/gen-ui-tool-based/page.tsx
  useComponent({
    name: "render_bar_chart",
    description: "Display a bar chart with labeled numeric values.",
    parameters: barChartPropsSchema,
    render: BarChart,
  });
```

The component itself is ordinary React: it reads only its props and can
stream in as the agent fills the payload. The example above uses
[Recharts](https://recharts.org) for the bar chart; it doesn't know
anything about CopilotKit.

<Callout type="info">
  The `name` you pass to `useComponent` is what the agent sees as the tool
  name. Make it a verb like `render_bar_chart` or `show_weather` so the LLM
  reliably picks it when the user asks for that visualization.
