# Agent Read-Only Context

> Publish UI values to the agent as a one-way read-only channel via useAgentContext.


<!-- interactive demo: readonly-state-agent-context -->


## What is this?

Sometimes you want the agent to *know* something about the current UI, like the logged-in user, the current page, or a recent activity log, but you don't want the agent to be able to modify it. That's what
`useAgentContext` is for: a one-way **UI → agent** channel for
read-only context.

Unlike full shared state (where the agent can call tools that mutate
the state back to the UI), `useAgentContext` values are pure inputs.
The agent sees them on every turn via the runtime's context injection,
but it has no setter and no tool to write them back.

## When should I use this?

Reach for `useAgentContext` instead of full shared state when:

- The value is **UI-owned** and has no meaning to the agent beyond
  "what the user is looking at right now".
- The agent should read but never write (user identity, feature flags,
  selected record, scroll position).
- You want the value to automatically unregister on unmount (e.g. the
  "current record" context disappears when you leave the page).

Think of it as "props for the agent".

## How it works in code

    ### Install the CopilotKit LangGraph SDK

    ```bash
    npm install @copilotkit/sdk-js

    ### Read CopilotKit context in your graph

    `useAgentContext` entries arrive on `state.copilotkit.context`. Extend
    your graph state with `CopilotKitStateAnnotation`, then prepend that
    read-only context as a system message before invoking the model.

    
~~~~typescript title="readonly-state.ts"
async function chatNode(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig) {
  const model = makeChatOpenAI(config, { model: "gpt-5.4" });

  // Inject read-only context from useAgentContext / useCopilotReadable.
  // Mirrors the `createAppContextBeforeAgent` logic in CopilotKitMiddleware:
  // context may be a string or an object — stringify it and prepend as a
  // system message right after the main system prompt.
  const appContext = state.copilotkit?.context;
  const isEmptyContext =
    !appContext ||
    (typeof appContext === "string" && appContext.trim() === "") ||
    (typeof appContext === "object" && Object.keys(appContext).length === 0);

  const systemMessages: SystemMessage[] = [
    new SystemMessage({ content: SYSTEM_PROMPT }),
  ];

  if (!isEmptyContext) {
    const contextContent =
      typeof appContext === "string"
        ? appContext
        : JSON.stringify(appContext, null, 2);
    systemMessages.push(
      new SystemMessage({ content: `App Context:\n${contextContent}` }),
    );
  }

  const response = await model.invoke(
    [...systemMessages, ...state.messages],
    config,
  );

  return { messages: response };
}

  </Step>
</Steps>

Call `useAgentContext({ description, value })` once per value you want
to publish. Each call registers a dynamic context entry with the
runtime that is:

- Refreshed whenever `value` changes (React re-renders).
- Automatically removed when the component unmounts.
- Surfaced to the agent via the backend's `CopilotKitMiddleware`, which
  threads the entries into the model's message history on every turn.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/readonly-state-agent-context/page.tsx
  useAgentContext({
    description: "The currently logged-in user's display name",
    value: userName,
  });
  useAgentContext({
    description: "The user's IANA timezone (used when mentioning times)",
    value: userTimezone,
  });
  useAgentContext({
    description: "The user's recent activity in the app, newest first",
    value: recentActivity,
  });
```

The `description` is important: it's a short human-readable label the
agent sees alongside the value, so it knows what to do with it. Treat
it like a parameter docstring.

## Wire it to your own state

`useAgentContext` doesn't care where the value comes from: local
state, a React Context, Redux, a query cache, anything. The only
requirement is that the identity of the value is stable enough for
React to avoid a render loop. In the demo we use a handful of
`useState` hooks; in a real app these would likely come from an auth
provider, a router hook, and your domain state stores.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/readonly-state-agent-context/page.tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotPopup,
  useAgentContext,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";

import { ACTIVITIES, DemoLayout } from "./demo-layout";
import { useReadonlyStateAgentContextSuggestions } from "./suggestions";

export default function ReadonlyStateAgentContextDemo() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit
      runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit"
      agent="readonly-state-agent-context"
    >
      <DemoContent />
      <CopilotPopup
        agentId="readonly-state-agent-context"
        defaultOpen={true}
        labels={{ chatInputPlaceholder: "Ask about your context..." }}
      />
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}

function DemoContent() {
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState("Atai");
  const [userTimezone, setUserTimezone] = useState("America/Los_Angeles");
  const [recentActivity, setRecentActivity] = useState<string[]>([
    ACTIVITIES[0],
    ACTIVITIES[2],
  ]);
```

## Read-only, by design

Because the agent never sees a setter or a mutation tool for these
values, there's no way for a confused LLM to "update" them. That
makes `useAgentContext` the right tool whenever the value in question
is an input, not a field: the "context object passed to the agent on
every turn", rather than "shared workspace you both edit".

When you need both reads *and* writes, you want full
**[shared state](/langgraph-typescript/shared-state)** instead.
