          A working chat with zero CopilotKit chrome. Nothing on the demo route
          is a CopilotKit component — the bubbles, the composer and the layout
          are all hand-written. CopilotKit still handles the part that is hard:
          agent communication, message management, streaming and tool-call
          rendering.

          Text and tool calls are all you get for free. Reasoning cards,
          A2UI/MCP activity messages and custom before/after message slots are
          rendered by <code>&lt;CopilotChatMessageView&gt;</code>, and going
          headless means not using it — so each has to be wired in by hand with{" "}
          <code>useRenderActivityMessage</code> and{" "}
          <code>useRenderCustomMessages</code>. The doc calls that its
          &quot;complete example&quot;; this route implements the minimal one,
          which is the version worth copying as a starting point.

          None of these hooks assume a chat. <code>useAgent</code> works in any
          component under the provider, so the same primitives drive a
          dashboard, a canvas or an inspector — see{" "}
