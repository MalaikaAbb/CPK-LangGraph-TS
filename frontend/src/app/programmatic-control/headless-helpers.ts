 * ⚠ SELF-DEFINED — not from the CopilotKit docs.
 *
 * The Programmatic Control page's `headless-complete` snippet opens by
 * destructuring three helpers it never defines:
 *
 *   useAttachmentsConfig()   — a thin wrapper over the real `useAttachments`
 *   useAutoScroll(...)       — stick-to-bottom scrolling
 *   buildContent(...)        — text + attachments → an AG-UI content array
 *
 * Only the first has a real counterpart in the package. The other two are
 * rebuilt here from how the snippet uses them, which is the reason the route
 * is marked Partial: the primitives it demonstrates (`addMessage`, `runAgent`,
 * `stopAgent`, `subscribe`) are the doc's, but the scaffolding around them
 * is this repo's guess at code that was never published.
