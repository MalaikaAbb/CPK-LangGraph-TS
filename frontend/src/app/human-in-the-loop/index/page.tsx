          The HITL overview&apos;s demo: <code>useHumanInTheLoop</code>{" "}
          registers a <code>book_call</code>-style frontend tool whose render is
          a time-picker card. The run suspends on the card until the user picks
          a slot or cancels, and the answer goes back to the agent as the tool
          result. The page also points to the other two patterns,{" "}
          <code>useInterrupt</code> (graph-side <code>interrupt()</code>) and
          headless interrupts, which have their own routes.

          Agent, demo page and time-picker card are the page&apos;s Code tab.
          The demo mounts its own <code>&lt;CopilotKit&gt;</code> against this
          repo&apos;s main runtime, where <code>hitl-in-chat</code> now maps to
          the doc&apos;s agent. <code>/human-in-the-loop</code> shares it. The
          Code tab&apos;s 190-line showcase <code>route.ts</code> is replaced
          by the existing runtime route; its <code>makeChatOpenAI</code> is
          borrowed from the showcase.
