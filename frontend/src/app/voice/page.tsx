          Speech into the composer. The user speaks, the runtime transcribes,
          and the transcript is submitted like any typed message. What makes it
          interesting is that <code>&lt;CopilotChat&gt;</code> takes no voice
          props at all — it grows a mic button because the runtime it is pointed
          at advertises <code>audioFileTranscriptionEnabled: true</code> on{" "}
          <code>/info</code>. The feature is configured entirely on the server.

        <p>
          The graph and the transcription service both use{" "}
          <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>, but they read it from different processes:
          the graph from the LangGraph server&apos;s environment, the mic from
          this Next app&apos;s. If the key is only in the repo-root{" "}
          <code>.env</code> and Next was started elsewhere, chat works and the
          mic does not. Without a key the route still runs — the sample-audio
          button bypasses <code>/transcribe</code> entirely — and clicking the
          mic returns a clean 401 rather than an opaque 500, because the service
          is wrapped in a guard.

        <p>
          The published route sets <code>graphId: &quot;starterAgent&quot;</code>,
          which is the name <code>npx copilotkit@latest create</code> writes into
          its <code>langgraph.json</code>. Nothing else on the page defines that
          graph, so copying the file as-is into a project with different graph
          names produces a 404 from the LangGraph server. This repo&apos;s
          registry calls the voice graph <code>voice-demo</code>, so that id is
          used instead — everything else in the file is the doc&apos;s.
