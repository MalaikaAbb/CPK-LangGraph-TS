          The same catalog can reach the browser two ways: the agent calls a{" "}
          <code>render_ui</code> tool the runtime adds (checked server-side as
          it streams), or it writes <code>a2ui</code> code blocks inside its
          reply (checked in the browser). <code>agentIds</code> limits which
          agents get any of it, and the runtime&apos;s{" "}
          <code>generativeUI</code> option controls when the tool is added.
