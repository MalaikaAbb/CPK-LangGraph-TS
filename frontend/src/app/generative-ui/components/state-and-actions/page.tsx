          Generated components can be wired back into the app. A catalog can
          declare <strong>state</strong> that your code fills and the agent
          never sets; <strong>functions</strong> that a component&apos;s event
          calls in the browser; <strong>events</strong> that, when no function
          matches, turn a click into a message to the agent; and{" "}
          <strong>writable</strong> props whose user edits stick.

            · Every snippet omits some imports (<code>z</code>,{" "}
            <code>createGenerativeUI</code>, <code>Cart</code>); added and marked.
          </li>
          <li>
            · The state catalog uses a <code>ProductCard</code> the page never
            prints; scaffolding renders <code>inCart</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            · <code>Cart</code> and <code>cart.addItem</code> are undefined; a
            React-state cart stands in.
          </li>
          <li>
            · &ldquo;Who may call&rdquo;, &ldquo;Send a click&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;Keep what the user types&rdquo; are fragments; the catalogs
            around them (and <code>PlanCard</code>) are scaffolding.
          </li>
          <li>
            · The state and functions catalogs declare only{" "}
            <code>ProductCard</code>, and a surface has one root, so two cards
            have nothing to sit in: the agent invents a container and the
            browser rejects the <code>createSurface</code>. Those two tabs give
            the provider a harness wrapper (<code>layout-catalogs.ts</code>)
            that extends the published catalog with <code>standardUI</code>;
            the published catalogs are unchanged.
          </li>
          <li>
            · The page says the agent cannot call renderer functions in this
            version whatever <code>allowedCallers</code> says, so the
            declarations are shown as exported rather than exercised.
