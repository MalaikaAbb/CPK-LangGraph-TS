          MCP servers whose tools carry UI resources. The runtime&apos;s{" "}
          <code>mcpApps.servers</code> config applies the MCP Apps middleware:
          when the agent calls such a tool, the middleware fetches the resource
          and emits an activity event, and the built-in renderer shows it as a
          sandboxed iframe in the chat. The demo points at the public Excalidraw
          MCP app (override with <code>MCP_SERVER_URL</code>).

          Agent, runtime route and demo page are the page&apos;s Code tab. The
          demo imports <code>./chat</code>, which the tab does not show, so{" "}
          <code>chat.tsx</code> and <code>suggestions.ts</code> come from the
          CopilotKit showcase, as does <code>makeChatOpenAI</code>. The runtime
          route also registers a <code>headless_complete</code> graph that this
          repo does not have (its id here is <code>headless-complete</code>);
          only the <code>mcp-apps</code> agent is used. See README §9.
