/**
 * One provider for the whole app, so a conversation survives navigation
 * between test routes.
 *
 * Three routes mount a second, nested `<CopilotKit>` of their own rather than
 * using this one — Voice (different runtime, because transcription only exists
 * on the v2 runtime) and the two A2UI routes (each needs its own catalog, and
 * dynamic-schema needs the runtime that still injects the A2UI tool). Those
 * are the cases where the doc page is specifically about the provider, so an
 * isolated instance is the honest thing to show.
 *
 * On the inspector prop name, which is genuinely confusing: the doc page says
 * `enableInspector`, and that prop exists — but only on `<CopilotKit>`, the v1
 * compatibility wrapper. All it does there is forward to this provider's
 * `showDevConsole`. As of 1.69.3 `enableInspector` exists on
 * `CopilotKitProvider` too, so the two are no longer distinguishable that way;
 * `showDevConsole` is kept here because it takes `"auto"` (localhost only),
 * which the boolean cannot express. See README §9.
 *
 * `inspectorDefaultAnchor` used to sit alongside it, pinning the inspector
 * button bottom-left so it would not cover the prebuilt Popup and Sidebar
 * launchers. 1.69.3 removed the prop with no replacement — the provider now
 * exposes no positioning control at all — so on routes that mount those
 * launchers the inspector button overlaps them again.
 *
 * Two props exist for Rich Threads:
 *
 * `headers` carries the identity `identifyUser` reads on the runtime. Threads
 * are per-user, so without it every visitor of a deployed copy would share one
 * history. A real app derives this from a verified session; a local harness has
 * none, so it sends a fixed demo identity you can override with
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_USER_ID to watch two thread lists diverge.
 *
 * `publicLicenseKey` is the client-side half of the license axis and what the
 * Threads Drawer doc's own sample passes; the server-side half is
 * `licenseToken` on the runtime. Either unlocks the drawer's real UI. With
 * neither, the drawer renders its locked "Upgrade" view even when threads are
 * working, because it gates on the reported license status rather than on
 * whether thread endpoints respond. It is genuinely public — unlike
 * INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY, which must never be prefixed NEXT_PUBLIC_.

/**
 * Hoisted to module scope on purpose — this must be a STABLE reference.
 *
 * Written inline as `headers={{ ... }}` it is a fresh object on every render,
 * and the provider treats a changed `headers` identity as a changed request
 * config: it rebuilds its client, which re-fetches thread lists and re-opens
 * realtime subscriptions. With a large agent registry that turns one re-render
 * into a burst of `GET /threads` + `POST /threads/subscribe` per agent, over
 * and over. The values are module constants, so the object never needs a new
 * identity.
