 * mode requires `intelligence` to be absent entirely. So the two shapes are
 * built in separate branches below rather than spread conditionally into one

/**
 * A SECOND, SEPARATE credential — and one of the two things that unlock the
 * Threads Drawer's UI.
 *
 * `INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` authorizes the runtime against the platform: it is
 * what makes `/info` report intelligence mode and what makes the thread REST
 * endpoints return real rows. It does NOT advertise a license.
 *
 * `licenseToken` is what does. The runtime builds a license checker from it,
 * and `/info` reports `licenseStatus` off that checker. Client-side feature UIs
 * read that field: `<CopilotThreadsDrawer>` renders its locked "Threads are a
 * CopilotKit Intelligence feature" view unless the status is valid, whether or
 * not threads actually work.
 *
 * So a runtime can serve threads perfectly while every drawer in the app shows
 * an Upgrade button. The drawer doc's own sample takes the other route to the
 * same place — a `publicLicenseKey` on the provider. This harness supports
 * both; see `components/providers.tsx`.
