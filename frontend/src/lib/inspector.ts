/**
 * Who owns the Inspector, decided in exactly one place.
 *
 * Two facts about `CopilotKitInspector` drive everything here:
 *
 *  1. **It is bound to one core.** The provider renders it as
 *     `<CopilotKitInspector core={copilotkit} />`, where `copilotkit` is *that
 *     provider's* instance. An inspector on the root provider is blind to a
 *     nested provider's traffic — you get a working inspector showing an empty
 *     event list, which reads like a broken inspector.
 *  2. **Two on one page is fatal.** Both are lit custom elements; mounting two
 *     spins lit-html into an unbounded assert loop that Next mirrors to the dev
 *     server, taking out the tab, the server, and potentially the machine.
 *
 * Together those mean: exactly one inspector per page, and it must be the one
 * attached to the provider the page's chat actually runs on. Three demo routes
 * mount their own `<CopilotKit>`, so on those the root provider stands down and
 * the nested one takes over.

 * Route subtrees where the Inspector is suppressed, on purpose.
 *
 * The Inspector is what turns the realtime thread defect from waste into a
 * broken agent. With it mounted, prompting fails with "Timed out joining
 * channel"; with it off, the same agent runs. Proven by A/B, with StrictMode on
 * in every case and `reactStrictMode: false` ruling React out:
 *
 *     inspector off                   -> agent runs
 *     inspector on                    -> Timed out joining channel
 *     inspector on + REST-only stores -> still fails
 *
 * The Rich Threads routes are the ones that actually exercise realtime threads,
 * so they are the ones that must stay runnable. Everywhere else keeps the
 * Inspector, which is the point of a QA harness.
 *
 * Prefix match, so each section and its `demo-chat` child are both covered.
 * See README §9.

 *
 *     shouldEnableInspector({ enableInspector, isBrowser, isDevelopment })
 *       => isBrowser && isDevelopment && enableInspector !== false
